Dataset Description The House Price Prediction Dataset is a tabular dataset in CSV format. It consists of 2,000 records and 10 features related to residential real estate. The data includes numerical characteristics such as house Area, number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and YearBuilt, alongside categorical attributes like Location, Condition, and Garage availability. The primary variable of interest is the Price of the house.

Machine Learning Problem Definition

Problem Type: This is a Regression problem. This classification is used because the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (the price) rather than a discrete label.

Target Variable: The target variable is Price. This is the specific value the model is being trained to predict.

Goal: The model is expected to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between a home's features (such as its size and geographical location) and its final market price. Once trained, the model can provide accurate price estimates for new house listings based on their specific characteristics.
